Changes made to the objfun.F90 file in the gpr-noah directory, 14 November 2019
- Change number of passed arguments
- Change order of lagged inputs
- Changing back the order of lagged inputs, this was the problem.
- rech and deeprech added back to state read/write. Also initialize obs_full
- removed them, because I was getting that bad value error.
- Read in full observation record, will be used to pin out-of-sample year
- use name as input to read/write state, change name to state.init
- Converting date year to character string, printing output to test.
- during training set the out-of-sample year to observation.
- move gpr call in logic to prevent the call when training wet/dry only
- cleanig the logic so it doesn't test for zeros twice
- Making sure the out-of-sample year gets set to the observation.
